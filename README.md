# 🎶 KO Unwrapped

**KO Unwrapped** is an interactive application that taps into the Spotify API to dynamically present my top 10 most-played artists and tracks.

Built with a modern frontend stack, the project focuses on creating an animated, visually engaging experience that turns listening history into a personal snapshot of musical tastes.

Although still in progress, KO Unwrapped is designed as a creative exploration of API integration and animation techniques.
